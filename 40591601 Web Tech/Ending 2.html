    <h1>Ending 2</h1>
    <p>You manage to crawl to the edge of the light</p>
    <p>The beasts slowly begin to burn in the sun</p>
    <p>Its shrieking not calming down, even in death</p>
    <p>Apart from its breath smelling like mold</p>
    <p>Upon the beasts fading into nothing, you are able to push yourself back onto your feet and leave through the entrance</p>
    <p>Standing at the entrance again, you think to yourself if going back in again would be a fun idea</p>
    <p>F*CK THAT!!!</p>

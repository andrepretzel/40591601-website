    <h1>Ending 1</h1>
    <p>Following the path even further down the tunnel of Fortune, you see a bright white light at the end</p>
    <p>Finally, you make it back outside</p>
    <p>You may look and smell like you just came out the toilet but a bit more bloody, Manky!!!</p>
    <p>You look back at what you accomplished and think what other journey awaits you</p>
    <p>But will it be worth it?</p>
    <li><a href="Game demo.html">Wish to Journey back?</a></li>
